# Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GANS-
This project is divided into two parts: in the first part, we are  implementing a specific type of GAN designed to process images, called a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN). We are training the DCGAN to generate emojis from samples of random noise. In the second part,  some methods are applied that researchers have suggested to "stablize" the training process of GANs and then train our DCGAN again.
# Requirements-
Pytorch
NumPy
